## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- JDK 21 or higher
- IntelliJ IDEA (recommended) or VS Code with Kotlin support
- Git

### Local Development
```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/your-username/LastServerKotlin.git
cd LastServerKotlin

# Build the project
./gradlew build

# Run tests (when available)
./gradlew test
```

## Coding Standards

### Kotlin Style Guide
- Follow [Kotlin Coding Conventions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coding-conventions.html)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions focused and small
- Use Kotlin idioms and features appropriately

### Code Structure
```
src/main/kotlin/dev/velocity/lastserver/
â”œâ”€â”€ LastServerPlugin.kt      # Main plugin class
â”œâ”€â”€ LastServerManager.kt     # Core business logic
â”œâ”€â”€ LastServerCommand.kt     # Command handling
â””â”€â”€ LastServerConfig.kt      # Configuration management
```

### Best Practices
- **Immutability**: Prefer `val` over `var`
- **Null Safety**: Use Kotlin's null safety features
- **Coroutines**: Use for async operations
- **Error Handling**: Handle exceptions gracefully
- **Logging**: Use appropriate log levels

### Example Code Style
```kotlin
class ExampleManager(
    private val server: ProxyServer,
    private val logger: Logger
) {
    fun processPlayer(player: Player) {
        // Use descriptive names and Kotlin idioms
        player.currentServer.ifPresent { server ->
            logger.info("[LastServer] Processing ${player.username}")
            // Implementation here
        }
    }
}
```

## Testing

- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Ensure existing tests pass
- Test with multiple Velocity versions
- Test with various network configurations

## Documentation

- Update README.md if adding new features
- Add KDoc comments to public APIs
- Update configuration examples if needed
- Include usage examples for new commands

## Commit Messages

Follow these guidelines for commit messages:

- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit first line to 72 characters
- Reference issues and pull requests when relevant

### Examples:
```
Add support for wildcard server exclusions

- Implement pattern matching for server names
- Update configuration documentation
- Add unit tests for wildcard matching

Fixes #123
```
